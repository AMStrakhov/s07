"""
Description:

You have an abstract base class `Employee`.
Create classes inherited from `Employee`:
Employee -> Manager
         -> Programmer
         -> Designer

Every manager has a list of subordinates â€” special attribute to store
the instances of other employees.

Every employee can work. But results of their work are different:
 * programmers should return string "code by <Employee>"
 (<Employee> is a string representation of the instance)
 * designers should return string "design by <Employee>"
 * and managers should make other employees work: they iterate through the list
 of their subordinates, call their `work()` methods and return a list of
 results.

Examples:
>>> manager = Manager("John", "Smith")
>>> programmer_1 = Programmer("Ada", "Lovelace", True)
>>> programmer_2 = Programmer("Guido", "van Rossum")
>>> designer_1 = Designer("Johny", "Ive")
>>> manager.subordinates.extend([programmer_1, programmer_2, designer_1])
>>> print(list(manager.work()))
[
  'code by programmer Mrs. Ada Lovelace',
  'code by programmer Mr. Guido van Rossum',
  'design by designer Mr. Johny Ive'
]
